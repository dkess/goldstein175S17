# Overview

In this lab we will work with the neo-classical growth model using a
cross-section of OECD countries. Our goals are two fold:

1. To derive some analytical properties of the model, assuming a
Cobb-Douglas production function.

2. To use these properties to assess how much of a difference
   population growth and savings rates make in explaining the income
   differences across countries.

The order of this lab will be slightly different in that we will start
with some mathematical derivations and then go on to analyze data
afterwards.


# Analytical results from the Solow model

We found in class that the steady-state equlibrium of the Solow model
is found when the amount of new capital equals that needed to maintain
the capital-labor ratio. Capital is increased via savings, and
decreases due to depreciation and the dilution effect of population
growth (which reduces the stock of capital per person). Equilibrium
values of per person output $y^*$ and per person capital k*$ satisfy
$$
'birth' of capital = 'death' of capital
$$
$$
s y = (n + d) k
$$

If we know the form of the production function $y(k)$, then we can
specify more precisely the steady state. We will assume that we have a
Cobb-Douglas Production function for the economy of the form

$$
Y = K^\alpha L^(1-\alpha),
$$

where $Y$ is national output, $K$ is the capital stock, and $L$ is the
size of the labor force. Here $\alpha$ is a parameters in the
model telling us about the form of diminishing returns.

We convert to per worker units, dividing both sides by $L$, which gives
$$
y = Y / L = K^\alpha / L^\alpha = (K/L)^\alpha = k^\alpha
$$
where $y$ is the per worker output, and $k$ is capital per worker.

Now we can do a bit of algebra to obtain expressions for $y^*$ and $k^*$.


Q.1 In the steady state, $k^*$ equals

A. $(s / (n + d))^(1 / (1 -alpha))$

B. $((n+d) / s))^(1 / (1 -alpha))$

C. $(s / (n + d) )$

D. $(s / (n + d))^(alpha / (1 -alpha))$


Q.2 In the steady state, $y^*$ equals

A. (k^*)^\alpha

B. $(s / (n + d))^(alpha / (1 -alpha))$

C. A and B are equivalent and both correct.


## Analyzing the steady state

We can get a sense of how changes in savings $s$ and population growth
will effect total output $y$. Typically $\alpha$ takes a value like
$1/3$, and so the exponent (\alpha / (1-\alpha)) is something close
to 0.5.

If we increase the savings rate, then we will increase the steady
state of output. If we increase population growth or the rate of
depreciation then we will make the denominator larger, giving a
smaller value of output.

Q.3 If s = .2, y.... hten ..

what is y*


Q.4 How much will income change if populaiton gorwth rates fall to ...


Q.5 How much will income change if savings rates double?


Q.6 What is the capital labor ratio in the steady state (with the
initala values in Q3? What is the capital lbaor ratio if population
growth rates fall as in Q4?


## The Solow Model and the Real World

Here we take a modern cross section of countries with approximately
the same level of technology.

filename <- "WeilDataExerciseCSVformat.csv"
url <- "http://wps.aw.com/wps/media/objects/14734/15088221/WeilDataExerciseCSVformat.csv"
## url <- paste0(path, filename)
df <- read.table(url, header = T, sep = ",", as.is = T)

oecd <- c(## "Australia",
    "Austria", "Belgium", "Canada", "Denmark",
          "Finland", "France", "Germany", "Greece",
          ## "Hungary",
          "Iceland",
      "Italy", "Japan", "Korea, Republic of",
      "Netherlands", "Spain", "Sweden",
      "Switzerland", "United States")

df <- df[df$Country %in% oecd,]
country <- as.character(df$Country)
country[country == "Korea, Republic of"] <- "Korea"
k <- df$kpw2009
y <- df$rgdpwk2009
s <- df$grodomsav09/100
n <- df$gpop/100
df <- df[,c("Country", "kpw2009", "rgdpwk2009", "grodomsav09", "gpop")]
df$Country[df$Country == "Korea, Republic of"] <- "Korea"

df2 <- data.frame(n,y,s,k)
rownames(df2) <- country

```

## Let's look at general relationships
```{r}
# population growth rate and income
plot(y ~ n, type = "n")
text(n,y, country,
     xlim = range(n)*1.2,
     cex = .85)
abline(lm(y ~ n))
```

Q... Is population growth associated with lower income?

A. Yes, there is a weak association, especially if we ignore the
United States.

B. Yes, there is a strong association, with few exceptions.

C. No, the relationship is in the other direction, with
faster growing populations consistently having higher incomes

Now we can see if the effect of population growth might be operating
through capital.

```{r}
# capitalk and income
plot(y ~ k, type = "n")
text(k,y, country,
     xlim = range(n)*1.2,
     cex = .85)
abline(lm(y ~ k))
```

Here we see that higher incomes are associated with more capital per
worker.

In fact, we can estimate the "elasticity" of income with respect to
capital from this data. In our Cobb-Douglas formulation, we had
$$
y = k^\alpha
$$
or
$$
\log(y) = \alpha \log (k)
$$
So, the slope of this log-log plot will be $alpha$.


```{r}
plot(log(y) ~ log(k), type = "n")
text(log(k),log(y), country,
     xlim = range(n)*1.2,
     cex = .85)
abline(lm(log(y) ~ log(k)))
```

Q.X Eyeballing the units and the line in the graph,
A. Alpha is about 1/4
B. Alpha is about 4
C. Alpha is about 1/2
D. Alpha is about 1

Hint: as log(k) increases from 12.0 to 12.3, how much does log(y)
increase?

The interpretation of elascicity alpha is that when we increase
capital by say 10% it will increase output by alpha*10%. If alpha is
1/3, then this means an increase of a bit more than 3%.

Diminishing marginal returns comes from the fact that $alpha <
1$. [Zhou Yi, is this right?]
