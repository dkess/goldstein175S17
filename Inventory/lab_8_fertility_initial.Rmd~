In this lab, we first go further into the cost-of-time model of
fertility, answering questions based on theory and experimentation
with the cost_of_time "app". Then, we look at fertility and
socio-economic data from historical cross-section provinces in
French-speaking Switzerland, trying to see how our models may or may
not be consistent with historical experience.

# Part 0. Preliminaries

We begin by downloading some data and functions to be used in the lab.


```{r}
tot = 0

```



The Cost_of_time app computes the optimal bundle (N, X) of N children
and X-dollars worth of consumer goods. The app plots two choices, one
based on the initial values of $(w, p, c, and I)$ and one for separate
values $(w', p', c', and I').

You can see the effect of changing any single value by changing any
one of the "Parameters to perturb."

You can see how these effect of these changes (e.g., increasing wages)
depends on the values of the other parameters by first changing the
initial parameter values, and then changing one of the "Parameters to
perturb".




# Background

We imagine potential parents choosing between the number of children
they want to have and the amount of "other goods" they want to
consume.

For simplicity, we let there just be one kind of "other goods", which
we denote $X$. And we let the price be $1 per unit of $X$.

The price of children has two components:

1. A fixed dollar expenditure per child $p$ for food, clothing, shelter,
schooling, toys, etc.

2. A time cost of $c$ hours per child. This dollar value of the time
cost depends on the parents wage.

Parents face a budget constraint. Their household income consists of
'outside income' $I$ and wage income $w L = w (T - c N)$.

1. 'Outside income' $I$ includes sources like interest on assets,
   inheritance, as well as the wage-earnings of someone who cannot
   spend their time with children.

2. Wage income is the hourly wage rate $w$ times the number of hours
   worked $L$. The number of hours worked is equal to the total time
   available for work $T$, minus the hours spent taking care of
   children. (In our simple model, there is no leisure.)

If the division of labor is such that men never take care of children,
and women divide their time between child-care and market work, then
one can think of $I$ as "male earnings" and $w (T- c N)$ as "female
earnings."

The family's expenditures must satisfy the budget constraint
$$
\mbox{Income} = \mbox{Consumption}.
$$
In our model, this means
$$
I + w (T- c N) = X + p N.
$$
We can re-arrange as
$$
I + w T = X + (p + c w) N,
$$
where the left-hand side is now "Full Income" and the right hand side
gives the consumption including the time-cost of children. The full
cost per child is thus $p + c w$.


The choice of how many children and how much "other goods" is made so
as to make the parents as happy as possible. We can use the same
Cobb-Douglas formulation that we used for production functinos earlier
in the semester as a convenient model for utility. We let the utility
of a particular choice of $X$ and $N$ be
$$
U(X,N) = X^a N^{1-a},
$$
where $0 < a < 1$.

Parents will choose $X$ and $N$ to maximize $U$, subject to their
budget constraint. There are many methods for solving this constrained
optimization problem, including:

* numerical search (trying all combinations of X and N that satisfy
the budget constraint). This is what we did in class.

* substitution. We rewrite our budget constraint so that we express
  one variable in terms of another. Then we substitute this expression
  into the utility function and maximize utility of this single
  variable function. (we will do this below)

* Lagrange multipliers. This is a general method for constrained
  optimization. Good to know, but beyond the mathematics we're using
  in this course.

## solving by substitution

The purpose of showing the derivation is to give you a sense of how
this is done. You don't need to be able to do this yourselves.

1. Express $X$ in terms of $N$.

From the budget constraint,
$$
I + w T = X + (p + c w) N,
$$
we can write
$$
X = (I + w T) - (p + cw) N
$$

2. Substitute into $U$

$$
U(X,N) = X^a N^{1-a},
$$
$$
U(X,N) = U(N) =  \left[ (I + wT) - (p + cw) N \right]^a N^{1-a}
$$

At the maximum, $U'(N) = 0$. But it is a bit easier to work with
$\log U$, which will reach a maximimum at the same value of $N$.

$$
\log U(N) = a\log{ \left[(I + wT) - (p + cw) N \right]} + (1-a)\log N
$$

$$
{d\log U(N) \over d N} = {-a (p + cw) \over
\left[(I + wT) - (p + cw) N \right]} + {(1-a) / N}
$$

When ${d\log U(N) \over d N} = 0$,
$$
{(1-a) / N} = {a (p + cw) \over
\left[(I + wT) - (p + cw) N \right]}
$$

Solving for $N$ gives us
$$
N^* = (1 - a) {I + w T \over p + cw}.
$$

We obtain $X^*$, by substituting $N^*$ into our earlier expression.
$$
X^* = (I + w T) - (p + cw) N^* = (I + w T) - (1-a)(I + w T) = a (I + w T).
$$
(Because of the properties of the Cobb-Douglas utility function, the
amount of $X$ chosen depends only on full income and is independent of
the price of children.)

## Analysis of the solution

With our solution
$$
N^* = (1 - a) {I + w T \over p + cw}
$$
in hand, we can now ask what effect changes in any of the parameters
will have on the choice of $N$.

For example, increasing $a$ will clearly reduce $N^*$. We can write
$$
\partial N \over \partial a < 0
$$

Likewise, we can see that
$$
\partial N \over \partial I > 0
$$

And since $p$ and $c$ are both in the denominator,
$$
\partial N \over \partial c < 0
$$
and
$$
\partial N \over \partial p < 0
$$.

The only effect that is ambiguous in sign is
$$
\partial N \over \partial w \lessgtr 0
$$.

Some additional mathematical manipulation shows that

$$
\partial N \over \partial w <  0, \mbox{ when } {T\over c} < {I \over p}.
$$.

So, while in class, we questions the usefulness of the cost-of-time
model in making predictions about the effect of a wage increase on
fertility, we see here that the model makes clear predictions about
the other variables. Increases in outside income $I$ unambigously
increase fertility. Increases in the price of children through $c$ or
$p$ unambigously reduce fertility. And changes in taste, by changing
the relative preferences $a$ for children vs. goods, are also
unambiguous in their effect.

For the purposes of this class, you do not need to be able to follow
every step in the mathematical derivation. What is important to
understand is that it is possible to analyze this model and discover
in a quite general way what predictions the model makes and what the
limits of the model are. The tractability of the model is what makes
it so useful for enhancing our understanding.


I. Questions on perturbation of initial parameters

For the following questions, we will leave the initial values of $w$, $p$,
$c$, and $I$ unchanged. (Tip: you can always refresh your browser to return
the app to its starting state.)


1. Effect of a wage increase, changing $w'$ from $15 to $30:

If we increase the hourly wage $w'$ from $15 to $30, what happens to
fertility? [1 sentence with actual values.]

What happens to utility? [1 sentence with actual values.]

What happens to consumption of goods? [1 sentence with actual values.]

2. If we increase outside income $I'$ from 1000 per week to $1,500 a week,
what happens to fertility? [1 sentence with actual values.]

3. If we reduce fixed costs $p'$ from $100 per week to $50 per week, what
   happens to fertility? [1 sentence with actual values.]

4. If we increase the time costs per child $c'$ from 10 to 15 hours per
   week, what happens to fertility [1 sentence with actual values.]

5. For which of the above does the direction of the effect
   depends on initial parameter values, and for which do you think the
   direction of the effect is unambiguous? (Hint: you can verify the
   analytical answers given in the previous section by
   experimentation.) [A sentence for each parameter.]

6. Now change the initial parameter value of $c$ from 10 hours per
   child to 2 hours per child before increasing wages from $15 per
   hour to $30 per hour.

   What is the effect of a wage increase on fertility now?
   [1 sentence with actual values.]

   Describe the relative size of the income and substitution effects
   that must be true for this effect to hold. [1 sentence saying which
   effect must dominate, no numbers needed.]

7. Review of concepts. For each of the following scenarios, specify
   how you could operationalize the scenario by changing a parameter,
   and what effect the change in the parameter would be expected to
   have on fertility. (For example, if the scenario was a cut in the
   inheritance tax, you could say that on average this would increase
   non-wage income I, and that the effect of increasing I would be
   unambigously to increase fertility.)

A. The government reduces the costs of elementary schooling (e.g. by
   getting rid of school fees). What parameter would you change, and
   what effect would this have on fertility?


B. Male income falls, but we live in a society in which only women
   take care of children. What parameter would you change, and what
   effect would this have on fertility?


C. Men becoming more involved in child care. One way of
   operationalizing is to increase $T$, the time that could be spent
   working or taking care of children. What other parameter would one
   want to change? How could these changes be made in a way that had
   no effect on fertility?

D. Infant mortality falls. If we conceptualize the costs per child as
   costs per surviving child, then this effectively lows the costs of
   children. What parameters would you change, and what effect would
   these changes have on fertility?


# Overview

In this homework, we take advantage of the wonderful coincidence that
R has a built in data set from the literature on the historical
demographic transition. The dataset has fertility, mortality, and a
number of economic and social indicators for 47 French-speaking
provinces of Switzerland in the years around 1888.

The goal of this homework is to see empirically what the determinants
of lower fertility appear to be -- and to see which of our economic
theories seem to be applicable in this case.


# 1. Understanding the variables

a) Read results of help(swiss) and answer the following T/F questions
```{r}
help(swiss)
```

i) Agriculture is the percentage of land area  dedicated to farming.
F

ii) Education and examination are measured only for males
T

iii) No measure of income is available
T

iv) "Catholic" is the fraction, not percentage, of people who are
Catholic.
T


b) What percent of children die before the age of 1 in Moutier?
```{r}
swiss["Moutier","Infant.Mortality"]
```

c) What is the district with the highest examination scores?
```{r}
swiss[which.max(swiss$Examination),]
```


# 2. Theoretical Expectations

Before going further on the analysis, write down what you expect the
relationship between fertility and the other variables to be according
to Becker's quantity-quality model.

We provide a model answer for "a." to show the format to use for the
other parts.

a. Infant mortality

(Answer: Higher infant mortality would effectively increase the price
of child quality. This would encourage parents to instead invest in
quantity, raising fertility. So I would expect higher fertility to be
found in provinces with higher infant mortality.)


b. Catholic
(Hint: Assume that this raises the psychological cost of limiting fertility.)

c. Education
(Hint: Give a two-part answer: first, the effect on parents
having more education; and second, the effect children having more
education)

d. Examination
(Hint: Think of this as a measure of the result of more investments in
the "quality" of children)

e. Agriculture

# Part 1. Population change over the demographic transition.

The first declines in mortality and fertility happened gradually in
Europe. More recently, the pace of demographic transition has
sped up. An early example of rapid demographic change, for which we
have excellent statistics, is Japan.

Until shortly after World War II, Japanese fertility remained
high. Mortality rates were improving, and the resulting population
growth was very fast -- indeed, rapid population growth was one of
reasons that Japan gave for expanding its empire.

After the War, fertility began to decline very rapidly.

```{r}

tfr.data <- read.table("http://courses.demog.berkeley.edu/goldstein175/Basket/japan_tfr.txt")
year.vec <- tfr.data$Year
tfr.vec <- tfr.data$TFR
plot(year.vec, tfr.vec, type = "o",
     main = "Japanese Period Total Fertility Rate")
```

In less than a decade, fertility fell to replacement levels near two
children per woman.

Q1.1 What do you think happened in 1966?

A. There was a mistake in the data collection. Records were lost, or a
calculation error must have been made.

B. The economy crashed

C. 1966 was an inauspicious year according to the Japanese zodiac, the
year of the "fire horse" in which it was unlucky to have a daughter
born.

D. Everything in C *and*  further evidence of intentionality
is that births were slightly higher both before and after 1966.

{{
qnumber = 1.1
correct.answer = "D"
hint = "Google 'Increased induced abortion rate in 1966, an aspect of
a Japanese folk superstition.'"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Google 'Increased induced abortion rate in 1966, an aspect of
a Japanese folk superstition.' (The next one is 2026)."
}}



We can see that the pace of mortality improvement was steady the
entire time.

```{r}
e0.data <- read.table("http://courses.demog.berkeley.edu/goldstein175/Basket/japan_e0_female.txt")
year.vec <- e0.data$Year
e0.vec <- e0.data$Female
plot(year.vec, e0.vec, type = "o",
     main = "Japanese Period Life Expectancy at Birth, Female")
```

Life expectancy is greatly influenced by the level of child
mortality. Right after WWII we see the enormous effects of reducing
child mortality. Today, mortality improvement is still steady, but
because the increases in survival are at older ages, the same pace of
improvement in mortality rates adds fewer years of life expectancy at
birth.


Q1.2 What is the pace of life expectancy improvement from 1980 to to
2010?

A. About 1 year per year.

B. About 2-3 years per decade

C. About 1 month per year

{{
qnumber = 1.2
correct.answer = "B"
hint = "Life expectancy at birth goes from about 75 to about 85 over the course of 3 decades"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Japan has become the world leader both in the level of period
life expectancy and the pace of improvement"
}}


Now we are ready to explore the history of Japan's age-structure.

```{r}
## read in matrix of population counts
tmp <- read.table(file = "http://courses.demog.berkeley.edu/goldstein175/Basket/japan_pop_matrix_1947_2015.txt")
colnames(tmp) <- gsub("X", "", colnames(tmp))
Nxt.mat <- as.matrix(tmp)
# ages 0-110 are rows of the matrix, years 1947-2015 are on the columns
dim(Nxt.mat)
# births for each year are given in the row labeled "0"
print(Nxt.mat["0",]) # or equivalently 'print(Nxt.mat[1,])'

```
Q1.3 What is happening to the number of births from 2014 to 2015?

A. They are increasing as a residual effect of past population growth.

B. They are declining at a rate of 1 or 2 percent a year


{{
qnumber = 1.3
correct.answer = "B"
hint = "Inspect the first row of the matrix of population
counts. Those age '0' are a good approximation of the number of
births, since infant mortality is very low in Japan"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Fertility has been low so long in Japan that births are
exponentially declining at a fairly steady rate"
}}


Let's now visualize the change in Japan's age structure. We start by
viewing the change frame-by-frame:

```{r}

year.vec <- colnames(Nxt.mat)
for (i in 1:length(year.vec))
{
    barplot(Nxt.mat[,i], horiz = T,
            xlim = c(0, 2.5 * 10^6),
            xlab = "Number of people N(x,t)", ylab = "Age x")
    title(year.vec[i])
##     Sys.sleep(1/10)
}

```

Or we can compare a few snapshots every 20 years.

```{r}
my.year.vec <- c("1950", "1970", "1990", "2010")
par(mfrow = c(1,4)) # this tells graphics window to display 1 row of 4 panels
for (i in 1:length(my.year.vec))
{
    print(i)
    this.year <- my.year.vec[i]
    barplot(Nxt.mat[,this.year], horiz = T,
            xlim = c(0, 2.5 * 10^6))
    title(my.year.vec[i])
}

```


If we look at the effects of fertility decline on the population
age-structure, we can see a very young population in the 1950s,
followed by a dramatic drop in the fraction of the young in the 1970s
and 1980s. Since the 1980s, the smaller birth cohorts have entered the
workforce, and the ratio of the elderly to workers has risen sharply.

From the point of view of population age-structure, is Japan worse off
today than it was right after WWII? From a well-being point of view,
we care about the social and economic roles of people of different
ages. Demographers use dependency ratios as summary statistics of the
population age-distribution.. We will use the following conventions,
where we define the youth as being aged 0-19, the workers aged 20-64,
and old-age'd as aged 65+.

* Youth Dependency Ratio: $ YDR = N(0-19) / N(20-64)$
* Old-age Dependency Ratio: $ OADR = N(65+) / N(20-64)$
* Total Dependency Ratio: $ TDR = YDR + OADR$

We will use R to loop through each year and create vectors for the
numbers of youth, workers, and elderly by year.

```{r}

x <- 0:110                              # ages

young.vec <- apply(Nxt.mat[x %in% 0:19,], 2, sum)
worker.vec <- apply(Nxt.mat[x %in% 20:64,], 2, sum)
old.vec <- apply(Nxt.mat[x %in% 65:110,], 2, sum)

ydr.vec <- young.vec/worker.vec
oadr.vec <- old.vec/worker.vec
tdr.vec <- oadr.vec + ydr.vec
plot(year.vec, tdr.vec)

```

Q1.4 Wait, is something wrong?

A. Yes, the total dependency ratio can not be greater than 1.0 -- we made
a mistake.

B. Yes, the total dependency ratio even with the contemporary, very aged
population, is lower than it was before fertility decline. We made a
mistake.

C. No. This could be right.



{{
qnumber = 1.4
correct.answer = "C"
hint = "Not 'A' because a ratio can take values greater than 1.0. Not
'B' because although the effect of aging on the YDR and OADR is clear,
the net effect on the TDR is ambiguous"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Nothing is wrong. As we'll see below"
}}

Let's now look at the three dependency ratios on the same graph:

```{r}

plot(year.vec, oadr.vec, ylim = c(0, 1.5),
     type = "l", col = "red", lwd = 3,
     ylab = "Dependents per worker")
lines(year.vec, tdr.vec, col = "black", lwd = 3)
lines(year.vec, ydr.vec, col = "blue", lwd = 3)
text(1960, .4, "Youth \n Dep Ratio",
     col = "blue")
text(1970, 1, "Total \n Dep Ratio",
     col = "black")
text(1960, .2, "Old \n Dep Ratio",
     col = "red")

```

Now we can see that the youth dependency ratio has fallen more than
the old-age dependency ratio has risen. Total dependency has not yet
reached it's post-war highs.

Q1.5 Why did the youth dependency ratio fall sooner than the old-age
dependency ratio rises?

A. Because when births fall, there is a lag of a few decades between
fewer babies and fewer workers.

B. Because total dependency fell and then rose.

C. Because mortality fell before fertility


{{
qnumber = 1.5
correct.answer = "A"
hint = "A correct statement, but doesn't answer the question."
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "This lull in dependency is called the 'Demographic Dividend'"
}}



# Part 2. Japan's Future?

We now project Japan's population (using the 1-sex projection model we
covered in lecture) to see how the history of low
fertility will play out over time. We assume here that fertility will
remain at current levels. This will tend to produce quite a bit of
population aging, more so that would occur if, as many expect,
fertility were to rebound somewhat. On the other hand, we also assume
no continued increase in longevity -- which is almost surely
unrealistic -- and thus our projection will have fewer survivors to
old age than is likely.  (Note: we also assume zero net migration --
which we do for simplicity, but which also may not be implausible.)

We begin by importing the projection matrix that made from 2014
rates found in the Human Fertility and Human Mortality Databases.

```{r}
## you can skip the details on how this is read in
tmp <- read.table("http://courses.demog.berkeley.edu/goldstein175/Basket/japan_projection_matrix_2014.txt")
colnames(tmp) <- gsub("X", "", colnames(tmp))
A.2014 <- as.matrix(tmp)
## but do let's look at the first row
print("Fertility rates: row 1 of the projection matrix")
print("(look for non-zero values at ages where women tend give birth)")
print(round(A.2014[1,],3))                       # [1,] indexes first row
```

And let's print some elements showing survivors
```{r}
print(A.2014[1:6, 1:6]) # the upper, left corner
print(A.2014[90:96, 90:96]) # towards the lower, right corner
```

To see the whole matrix is a bit difficult since it is so large. You
can scroll. But you can also do a 3-d picture.

```{r}
persp(x = 0:110,
      y = 0:110,
      z = t(A.2014),                    # transpose for cleaner view
      phi = 35,                         # viewing angle
      xlab = "Age ('in')",
      ylab = "Age ('out')",
      col = "pink",
      expand = .2,
      zlab = "Transition rate")
```

Here, the "fin" along the diagonal is survivorship and the very little
ridge in front is the first row for reproduction.



Q2.1 The sum of the first row elements should be closest to

A. Life expectancy

B. The total fertility rate, the average number of children a woman
would have if she survived through childbearing.

C. The net reproduction rate, the average number of newborn girl would
have would have, accounting for her probability of dying before she
completes childbearing.

D. The average number of daughters the average woman would have if she
survived through childbearing.

{{
qnumber = 2.1
correct.answer = "D"
hint = "By leaving out the survival elements, we are effectively
conditioning on 100% survival of the women. As we mentioned
in lecture, we project a one sex population."
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Yes, this is how many daughters a woman who experienced
100% survival would have"
}}


## Projection

Here is some code to project the 2014 population up to 2017.


```{r}
## create a new matrix to store the past and future population in by age
x <- 0:110
year.vec.new <- 1947:2100
Nxt.mat.new <- matrix(NA,
                      nrow = length(x),
                      ncol = length(year.vec.new))
dimnames(Nxt.mat.new) <- list(x, year.vec.new)
Nxt.mat.new[, year.vec.new %in% year.vec] <- Nxt.mat

## check to see how full it is
image(y = x,
      x = year.vec.new,
      z = t(Nxt.mat.new))
## another view (you can play with phi and theta values to change angle)
persp(y = x,
      x = year.vec.new,
      z = t(Nxt.mat.new),
      zlab = "Population N(x,t)",
      xlab = "Time t",
      ylab = "Age x",
      phi = 70, theta = -25)
```

Now we project up to 2017.

```{r}
future.year.vec <- 2015:2017
for (i in 1:length(future.year.vec))
{
    ## The Nxt matrix is indexed by columns with years as characters
    ## so we to refer to N[,"2017"], not N[,2017] (which would be the
    ## 2017th column)
    ## To make this work, we first manipulate the years as numbers and
    ## then convert them to characters before using them as indices.
    to.year = future.year.vec[i]
    from.year = to.year - 1
    to.string <- as.character(to.year)
    from.string <- as.character(from.year)
    ## Now we can do our projection
    print(to.string)
    Nxt.mat.new[,to.string] <- A.2014 %*% Nxt.mat.new[,from.string]
}
```

And we can view the results in several ways.

```{r}
image(y = x,
      x = year.vec.new,
      z = t(Nxt.mat.new))
abline(v = 2014, col = "black", lwd = 1, lty = 2)

persp(y = x,
      x = year.vec.new,
      z = t(Nxt.mat.new),
      phi = 60, theta = -20)
```


### Analysis of Projection (your turn)

For this section, you should create new r-code chunks.

1. Project the population using the same "2014" projection matrix from
   2017 to 2100. (You can do this by copying the code above and making
   some small modifications.)

2. Make a plot of the youth, old-age, and total dependency ratios from
   1947 to 2100. (You can do this by copying the code we used for
   calculating and graphing the intitial population Nxt.mat).


Graded Question 1.

A. Submit a copy of your graph of the dependency ratios from 1947
to 2100. You can put your name on it by using the command

> text(x = 2050, y = 1, "Alfred E. Newman")

B. Will workers will have a harder time supporting dependents in 2100
than in 1947? Please give a yes or no answer. But do state what you
are assuming about the burden of different aged dependents. (Either
answer can be correct, as long as it is consistent with your stated
assumption.) [ < 25 words]



# Part 3. Adding detail with refined age-schedules

Do kids really "cost" the same as the elderly? Does a 20 year old
produce as as much as a 50 year old? Does a 90 year old need more care
than a 70 year old?

Survey data enables age-specific estimates of consumption and
production by age. The methodology for creating these estimates is
somewhat complex, but the findings are quite robust. Here we take
advantage of the schedules that were used by Ron Lee et al. (http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/suppl/2014/10/08/346.6206.229.DC1/Lee.SM.pdf) in
order to examine at a finer scale the effects of age structure on the
economy.

Let's look at the estimates of production and consumption by single years
of age in Japan.

```{r}
df <- read.table("http://courses.demog.berkeley.edu/goldstein175/Basket/japan_nta_schedules.txt")
x <- 0:110
cx <- df$cx                             # consumption by age
yx <- df$yx                             # production by age
## (techical note 1: this "yx" is actually labor income).
## (technical note 2: we don't have data over age 90, so we extrapolated)
yx[x > 90] <- 0
cx[x > 90] <- 0

million = 10^6
plot(x, cx,
     type = "l", col = "red",
     ylim = c(0, 5 * million),
     ylab = "cx, yx",
     xlab = "age x",
     main = "Consumption and production, \n Japan c. 2010")
lines(x, yx, type = "l", col = "blue")
```

Note: the decline to zero at age 90 and beyond is because there is
missing data. (We discuss this the effect of this missing data in
Question 5 at the end of the lab, but for now we will assume the true
values are zero.)

Q3.1 What are plausible units for the y-axis

A. Annual dollars per person by  year of age

B. Life-time dollars per person up to that age

C. Annual yen per person by  year of age

D. Life-time yen per person up to that age

{{
qnumber = 3.1
correct.answer = "C"
hint = "There are about 113 yen to the dollar."
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Earnings peak at something like $45,000 per person, which sounds plausible"
}}


Q3.2 At what age do Japanese first produce as much as they consume?

A. About age 45

B. About age 25

C. About age 20

D. About age 60


{{
qnumber = 3.2
correct.answer = "B"
hint = "Look at the cross-overs"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Rising earnings coincide with less consumption (which
includes educational expenses)."
}}

Q3.3 True or False. The schedules imply that the Japanese population
consumes much more than they produce, since the area below the red
line is much larger than the area below the blue line.

A. True.

B. False.

{{
qnumber = 3.3
correct.answer = "B"
hint = "In the population there are different numbers of people at
each age."
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "In order to consider the total production and
consumption, these ages need to be weighted by the population age distribution."
}}


### Support Ratios

We can apply these more refined age-schedules of economic activity to
the Japanese population that we have already observed and forecast
from 1947 to 2100.

The support ration in year $t% is defined as
$$
SR(t) = { \sum_x N(x,t) y(x,t) \over \sum_x N(x,t) c(x,t)},
$$

where
* $N(x,t)$ is the number of people aged $x$ in year $t$,
* $y(x,t)$ is the production per person aged $x$ in year $t$,
and
* $c(x,t)$ is the consumption per person aged $x$ in year $t$.

In what follows, we assume that $y(x,t)$ and $c(x,t)$ remain constant
at the levels observed in about 2010.

We now calculate the support ratio over the entire period,
1947-2100. (Just make sure that you have done your projection already,
so that your "Nxt.mat.new" is already filled in completely.)

```{r}
SR.vec <- NULL
for (i in 1:length(year.vec.new))
{
    total.production.of.population <- sum(yx * Nxt.mat.new[,i], na.rm = T)
    total.consumption.of.population <- sum(cx * Nxt.mat.new[,i], na.rm = T)
    SR.vec[i] <- total.production.of.population/
        total.consumption.of.population
}
plot(year.vec.new, SR.vec)
```

Q3.4 Taking into account the detailed profiles of consumption and
production by age, what does Support Ratio show about dependency in
2100 compared to 1947?

A. The Support Ratio is lower in 2100 than in 1947, so this means less
dependency.

B. The SR is lower in 2100 than in 1947, so this means there are fewer
producers per equivalent-unit consumer, effectively *increasing*
dependency.

{{
qnumber = 3.4
correct.answer = "B"
hint = "Look at the numerator and denominator of the definition and
ask if it is good to have a bigger or smaller SR"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Yes, assuming that the age profiles of consumption and
production remain unchanged."
}}


# Part 4. Optimimum fertility (using stable populations)

In this final section of the lab, we try to reproduce some of the
results on optimal fertility in the Lee et al. reading.

We follow Lee et al in optimising is the "support ratio",
but this time with stable opulation age structures

$$
SR = { \sum_x n_r(x) y(x) \over \sum_x n_r(x) c(x)},
$$

where $n_r(x)$ is proportion of  people aged $x$ in the stable
pouplation with exponential growth rate $r$, $y(x)$ is the
production per person aged $x$ observed in 2010, and $c(x)$ is the
consumption per person aged $x$ observed in 2010.

In a stable population, we derived in class the result that
$$
n_r(x) = b e^{-rx} \ell(x),
$$
where $n_r(x)$ is the proportion of people aged $x$ in a stable
population with exponential growth rate $r$.

Substituting, the stable age formula gives us
$$
SR(r) = { \sum_x e^{-rx} \ell(x) y(x) \over \sum_x e^{-rx} \ell(x) c(x)},
$$

We can now use this formula to study how the support ratio will vary
with the growth rate of the population and with fertility.

Let's begin by specifying a vector with growth rates corresponding to
different total fertility

```{r}
## let TFR range from 1 to 3, in 1/10 of a child increments
tfr.vec <- seq(from = 1, to = 3, by = .1)
## calculate implied pop growth rate "r"
r.vec <- log(tfr.vec / 2.05) / 30
## Here, we divide number of children of both sexes by 2.05 to get the
## number of daughters (since about 105 boys are born per 100
## girls). The generation length is assumed to be 30 years.
plot(tfr.vec, r.vec)
```

Now let's calculate the support ratio $SR(r)$ for each value of
exponential growth.

First we need a survival curve. For this we use the subdiagonal of
the projection matrix, which is a close enough for our purposes.
```{r}
## (no need to understand this)
surv.subdiagonal.of.projection.matrix <- diag(A.2014[-1, -ncol(A.2014)])
Lx <- cumprod(c(1, surv.subdiagonal.of.projection.matrix))
## check to make sure it gives reasonable life expectancy
e0.check <- sum(Lx)
print(e0.check)
```


```{r}
SR.vec <- NULL
for (i in 1:length(r.vec))
{
    r <- r.vec[i]
    nx.r <- exp(-r * x) * Lx
    total.production.of.population <- sum(yx * nx.r)
    total.consumption.of.population <- sum(cx * nx.r)
    SR.vec[i] <- total.production.of.population/
        total.consumption.of.population
}
## let's plot as a function of "r"
plot(r.vec, SR.vec, axes = T)
## and again as a function of tfr
plot(tfr.vec, SR.vec, axes = T)
## now we can add a line at the maximum by eyeballing and guessing the
## value
abline(v = 2.6)
## or more exactly
opt.tfr <- tfr.vec[which.max(SR.vec)]
abline(v = opt.tfr, col = "red")
print(opt.tfr)
```

We see here that the "optimal" fertility rate is greater than 2.


Q4.1 This value corresponds to which value of table 2 on page 232 of in Lee et al.

A. 1.34

B. 2.70

C. 2.33

D. 1.88

E. 1.57

{{
qnumber = 4.1
correct.answer = "C"
hint = "Match the concept in the column headers"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "We come very close indeed, but probably use a slightly
different mortality schedule. Something else to think about is why the
optimal TFR for the Fiscal Support Ratio is even higher."
}}

The other thing to note is the Support Ratio with optimal fertility
rate is not that much higher than that obtained with plus or minus half a
child or so. The curve $SR(r)$ has a very flat peak. This is because
when comparing across stable populations, the increase in the old from
slower pouplation growth is largely offset by decrease in the young.


# Part 5. Another Capital Idea

To finish up, let's combine the fertility on  population age
structure, with the effects of fertility on the population growth rate
and capital accumulation. We can use the Solow model once
again to gain some insights into both the qualititative and the
quantitative effects of population growth rates.

There are possible many ways to do this. (Those interested in the
details can consult the "supplementary materials" of the Lee et al
paper in Science).  For the lab, we will reproduce the "low cost capital
approach," which assumes that the capital-output ratio stays constant
over time. (This is what we already saw Piketty building upon.)

In the Solow model, we saw that if one wants to perserve a constant
stock of capital per person, faster population growth rates need to be
matched with larger fractions of income saved.

In the steady state, we have savings per person equaling the new
capital needed to keep up with population growth $n$, depreciation
$d$, and technological advances $\lambda$,
$$
s y = (n + d + \lambda) k
$$

We can rearrange this steady-state to give us.

$$
s = (n + d + \lambda) (k / y)
$$

Lee et al.  assume standard values such that $k/y \approx 3.0$, $d
= 0.05$, and $\lambda = .02$. This allows calculation of $s$ as a
function only of $n$.

```{r}
d = .05
lambda = .02
ky.ratio = 3.0
s.vec = (r.vec + d + lambda) * ky.ratio
plot(r.vec, s.vec)
```

To take account of the effect of increased savings on the support
ratio, we reduce the effective production of workers by a factor of
$(1-s)$. This operationalizes the idea that the more savings is
required, the less produciton is available for consumption.

$$
SR_{capital} = { \sum_x (1- s_r) e^{-rx} \ell(x) y(x) \over \sum_x e^{-rx} \ell(x) c(x)},
$$

where we use the savings rate $s_r$ that corresponds to the
population growth rate $r$.

```{r}

## This is  the "low capital" case, where the capital-income ratio is
## fixed at 3.0. This is would happen if we had Cobb-Douglas.

## In this case, the a share "s" needs to be set aside from income as
## savings, and cannot be consumed. So we exclude this share from the
## numerator of the support ratio.

SR.low.capital.vec <- NULL

## let's get the savings rate for each growth rate
s.vec <- (r.vec + d + lambda) * ky.ratio
plot(tfr.vec, r.vec)
for (i in 1:length(r.vec))
{
    r <- r.vec[i]
    my.Nx <- Lx * exp(-r * x)
    s <- s.vec[i]
    SR.low.capital.vec[i] <-  sum((1- s) * my.Nx * yx) / sum(my.Nx * cx)
}
plot(tfr.vec, SR.low.capital.vec)
opt.tfr.low.capital <- tfr.vec[which.max(SR.low.capital.vec)]
print(opt.tfr.low.capital)
abline(v = opt.tfr.low.capital, col = "red")
```
