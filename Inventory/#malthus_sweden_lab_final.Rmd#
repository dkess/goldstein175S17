# Overview

Sweden has the longest historical series of reliable vital statistics
in the world. The Human Mortality Database, founded at Berkeley, has
records for counts of births, deaths, and population size since 1751,
well before the demographic transition.


Malthus visited Norway and Sweden and describes his travels in his 2nd
edition of (An Essay on the Priciple of
Population). [http://www.econlib.org/library/Malthus/malPlong7.html#II.II.2].Please skim these two chapters for a better understanding about
Malthus's thinking on how the environment and human custom interact to
produce demographic outcomes.


In this lab, our goals are to:

1. To assess if the 18th century Swedish series of births and deaths is
consistent with Malthusian theory and see if we can detect a weakening
of Malthusian regime in the 19th and 20th centuries.

2. To learn how to use custom functions like malthus.plot.fun() by
   changing their arguments (without rewriting the functions themselves).

3. To use the non-graded interactive questions we have written for you
   (e.g., Q.1.1, Q.1.2).



# Part 0: Import the data


```{r}

## Note: you need to run this code to do the lab. But understanding it
## is optional.

## Read in the data from a file on the web using next two lines
url <- "http://courses.demog.berkeley.edu/goldstein175/Basket/SWE_pop_birth_death.txt"
df <- read.table(url, header =T)

## Display the first few rows of the object "df"
head(df)

## Create a separate object for popualtion size, births, deaths, and year.
## Note: "read.table()" imports as a "data.frame", which stores each
## column of a data set as a separate element, which can be accessed
## with the dollar-sign, as below.
N <- df$N                               # population size
B <- df$B                               # births
D <- df$D                               # deaths
year <- rownames(df)
## Note: N, B, D, and year are vectors. In the last lab we used ".vec" in the names of the vectors. Here we omit this to make our code more readable.

```

# Part 1: Inspect and understand the data

Plot the history of Swedish population size, counts of births, and counts of deaths.

```{r}
plot(year, N, type = "l")
```

Q1.1 How big is the population of Sweden in 1800

A.  about 20 thousand

B.  about 200 thousand

C.  about 2 million

D.  about 20 million

```{r}
## Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)
answer1.1 = NA
check(answer1.1)
```

To get a more readable plot we can change units
```{r}
million = 1000000
N.millions <- N/million
plot(year, N.millions, type = "l")
```

Q1.2 What is the average (exponential) growth rate of Sweden from 1751
to 2014.
```{r}
log(N[year == "2014"]/N[year == "1751"]) / (2014 - 1751)
```
Which value is this closest to?

A.  1 percent

B.  6 percent

C.  0.5 percent

D.  0.005 percent.

```{r}
## Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)
answer1.2 = NA
check(answer1.2)
```


```{r}
# plot of Deaths by year, with type = "line"
plot(x = year, y = D, type = "l")

```

Q1.3. In what year did Sweden have the most deaths?

A.  In about 2000, because the population age structure shifted to older ages.

B.  In about 1850

C.  In 1773

```{r}
## Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)
answer1.3 = NA
check(answer1.3)
```

Q1.4 When were births at their low?

A.  In the great depression (1930s)

B.  In the low fertility of the economic recession at the end of the 1990s.

C.  In about 1773

```{r}
## Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)
answer1.4 = NA
check(answer1.4)
```



# Part 2: Time trends in crude rates (per capita births and deaths)

Let's get the births and deaths on a per capita basis. Demographers call these crude rates. ("Crude" because we don't refine the population at risk -- for example, we include women and men in the denominator of the birth rate.)

```{r get.rates, fig.height=5}
cbr = B/N                               # crude birth rate
cdr = D/N                               # crude death rate
par(mfrow = c(2,1))                     # two panels in one plot
plot(year, cbr, type = "l", main = "Crude birth rates, Sweden")
plot(year, cdr, type = "l", main = "Crude death rates, Sweden")
```

Q2.1 The time trends in this plot are:

A.  Basically the same as in the counts

B.  Quite different from the counts

```{r}
## Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)
answer2.1 = NA
check(answer2.1)
```

Q2.2. In what year was the peak death rate

A.  In the same year as the peak number of births

B.  In the the most recent year

C.  In 1773, the same year as the peak number of deaths

```{r}
## Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)
answer2.2 = NA
check(answer2.2)
```

Q2.3 Google "1773 Sweden". What happened in this year?

A.  There was a war

B.  There was a famine

C.  The borders of Sweden changed.

```{r}
## Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)
answer2.3 = NA
check(answer2.3)
```


# Part 3: Detecting Malthusian dynamics

In class, we gave a two-panel graphical explanation of the Malthusian
model. In the upper panel, we showed  the
relationship between wages and birth and death rates. In the lower
panel, we showed the relationship between population size and
wages. Together, these two panels create the feedback loop for a very
low growth Malthusian economy and population.

Here, we will look at whether one part of the Malthusian world appears
to hold: that births and deaths go in opposite directions in good and
bad times. We don't have a measure of wages, so our inference is going
to be indirect, looking at the relationship between births and deaths
by year.

Q3.1. What relationship between births and deaths would be consistent
with a Malthusian economy

A.  As births go up, deaths go up

B.  As birth rates go up, deaths rates go up

C.  As births go down, deaths go up

D.  As birth rates go down, death rates go up.

```{r}
## Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)
answer3.1 = NA
check(answer3.1)
```

```{r}
malthus.plot.fun <- function(from.year, to.year)
{
  ## a scatter plot of crude birth and death rates
  ## note: this function assumes that cdr and cbr already exist.
  ## If you're having problems, try running the code chunk above
  ## that creates the cbr and cdr
  my.years <- from.year:to.year
  s <- year %in% my.years
  plot(cdr[s], cbr[s], type = "n",
       xlab = "Crude death rate", ylab = "Crude birth rate")
  abline(lm(cbr ~ cdr, subset = s))
  text(cdr[s], cbr[s], year[s], cex = .5)
  my.cor <- round(cor(cdr[s], cbr[s]), 2)
  title(paste("Birth and Death Rates in Sweden, from", from.year,
              "to", to.year, "\n Correlation:", my.cor))
}

## now let's plot the first 50 years
malthus.plot.fun(from.year = 1751, to.year = 1800)
## malthus.plot.fun(from.year = 1801, to.year = 1850)
## malthus.plot.fun(from.year = 1851, to.year = 1900)
## malthus.plot.fun(from.year = 1851, to.year = 1900)
```
Q3.2 Which of the patterns in Q3.1 (A,B,C,or,D) does this match most closely?

```{r}
## Replace the 'NA' with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)
answer3.2 = NA
check(answer3.2)
```


Q3.3 Is the pattern seen from 1751 to 1800 consistent with Malthusian theory?

A. Yes

B. No

```{r}
## Replace the 'NA' with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)
answer3.3 = NA
check(answer3.3)
```

We see that when birth rates are low when death rates are high (e.g.,
in 1772 and 1773). Even if we ignore these unusual years,
there is a generally negative relationship. Now plot the relationship
for the following time periods.

1801-1850
```{r}
## put your code here
```
1851-1900
```{r}
## put your code here
```
1901-2014
```{r}
## put your code here
```
