explanation2.2 = "We now see that the more capital we have per worker,
the greater the capital share of the economy is! This is what Piketty
argues is likely to happen. As growth rates fall, capital per worker
will increase, and with it an increase in the capital share of the
economic output. Note that Piketty's view on this is empirically
driven and runs counter to what many theorists, who believe more in
the Cobb-Douglas-ness of the world."
