0. Comparative Statics (or dyanmics with App)

a) What happens to per capita income if population growth rate falls from 1% to -0.5% (this is equilalent to a change in TFR from 3 to 1.5 ...)

b) What happens if double savings rate from ... to ... (corresponding to the difference between US and Austria)
[describe in a sentence. Give the approximate values from hte App, e.g., y goes from 2 to 5).]


c) What population growth rate would maximize per capita income? (Explain in one sentence)
A. As large as possible
B. As small as possible
C. A specific value that we cannot compute unless we know more parameter values.



1. Analysis of C-D production function

a) Show that the steady state of capital per worker is ...? Assume production function is Cobb-Douglas, with savings rate "s", depreciation "d", and population growth rate "n".

We showed in class that.

s ys = (n + d)  ks

If $y = A k^alpha$, show using algebra that

ks = A (s / (n+ d))^(1/(1-alpha))

b) Show using algebra that

ys = A (s / (n+d))^(alpha/(1-alpha))

[should we include A? Yes in order to get realistic numbers that they can assess if they are right. But if so, you have to explain that with scale-free production fucntions, it makes no difference what A is to the qualityative features of the model. ]

c) If n = .01 and d = .1, and alpha = 1/3, then what is ks, and what is ys?

2. Using data for 2009, let's see how much of the variation between OECD countries can be explained with the Solow model.
(Note: we are using a strong form of the model, with every country having the same "technology" A, and comparing economies in transition as if they were in their steady states.)

a) Plot y and n

b) Calculate k.hat

c) Plot k and k.hat, discuss fit and and non-fit.

d) Calculate y.hat, plot y and y.hat, discuss ...

-----------------






b) Show What is steady state of output per worker?

# A different approach (doing predicted per capita gdp)

## 1. We estimate alpha in C-D produciton fucntion

```{r}
my.s <- df$Country %in% c("Brazil", "China", "France", "Germany", "Greece",
                          "Japan", "Mexico", "Nigeria", "India", "Taiwan",
                          "United States")

                          "Japan", "United States", "Canada",

Q1. Which country has the highest savings rate

## assume alpha = 1/3 and depreciation = .1

# let's get k.hat (assuming cobb-douglas)

k.hat <- (s/(n+d))^(1/(1-alpha))

## check question here


A <- mean(k/k.hat)

# scatter plot of capital per person (k) and gdp

```{r}
k <- kpw1975 <- df$kpw1975 ## capital per worker in 1975

plot(k, y, type = "p")

## we can try 2005
k <- kpw2009 <- df$kpw2009 ## capital per worker in 2009
y <- gdp2005 <- df$rgdpch2005
points(k, y, col = "blue")

```
# Let's see if we can explain the difference in gdp

We start with population and then see how much controlling for the
k reduces effect of popualtion.

```{r}

k <- kpw1975 <- df$kpw1975 ## capital per worker in 1975
n <- df$gpop
y <- gdp1975 <- df$rgdpch1975

## k <- kpw2009 <- df$kpw2009 ## capital per worker in 2009
## y <- gdp2005 <- df$rgdpch2005
