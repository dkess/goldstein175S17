In this lab, we will use Japan to illustrate the changes in
age-structure that are resulting from the demographic transition and
continued population aging.

Specifically, we will investigate:

1. What has happened to the share of elderly and children over from
World War II until today.

2. What will happen if current levels of fertility and mortality
continue.

and

3. How to use stable age-structures and the Solow model to understand
the effect of fertility on consumption in the macro-economy.


# Part 0. Preliminaries

We begin by downloading some data and functions to be used in the lab.

```{r}
```

```{r}
tot = 0

```

# Part 1. Population change over the demographic transition.

The first declines in mortality and fertility happened gradually in
Europe. More recently, the pace of demographic transition has
sped up. An early example of rapid demographic change, for which we
have excellent statistics, is Japan.

Until shortly after World War II, Japanese fertility remained
high. Mortality rates were improving, and the resulting population
growth was very fast -- indeed, rapid population growth was one of
reasons that Japan gave for expanding its empire.

After the War, fertility began to decline very rapidly.

```{r}

tfr.data <- read.table("../Basket/japan_tfr.txt")
year.vec <- tfr.data$Year
tfr.vec <- tfr.data$TFR
plot(year.vec, tfr.vec, type = "o",
     main = "Japanese Period Total Fertility Rate")
```

In less than a decade, fertility fell to replacement levels near two
children per woman.

Q1.1 What do you think happened in 1966?

A. There was a mistake in the data collection. Records were lost, or a
calculation error must have been made.

B. The economy crashed

C. 1966 was an inauspicious year according to the Japanese zodiac, the
year of the "fire horse" in which it was unlucky to have a daughter
born.

D. It was an inauspicious year and further evidence of intentionality
is that births were slightly higher both before *and* after 1966.

{{
qnumber = 1.1
correct.answer = "D"
hint = "Google: "Increased induced abortion rate in 1966, an aspect of
a Japanese folk superstition."
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Google: Increased induced abortion rate in 1966, an aspect of
a Japanese folk superstition. (The next one is 2026)."
}}



We can see that the pace of mortality improvement was steady the
entire time.

```{r}
e0.data <- read.table("../Basket/japan_e0_female.txt")
year.vec <- e0.data$Year
e0.vec <- e0.data$Female
plot(year.vec, e0.vec, type = "o",
     main = "Japanese Period Life Expectancy at Birth, Female")
```

Life expectancy is greatly influenced by the level of child
mortality. Here we see the enormous effects of reducing child
mortality right after WWII. Mortality improvement is still steady, but
this has little effect on survival at younger ages which is nearly
universal.

Q1.2 What is the pace of life expectancy improvement from 1980 to to
2010?

A. About 1 year per year.

B. About 3 years per decade

C. About 1 month per year

{{
qnumber = 1.2
correct.answer = "B"
hint = "It goes from about 75 to about 85 over the course of 3 decades"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Japan has become the world leader both in the level of period
life expectancy and the pace of improvement"
}}


We can look at all of the years frame-by-frame

```{r}
## read in matrix of population counts
tmp <- read.table(file = "../Basket/JPN_pop_matrix_1947_2015.txt")
colnames(tmp) <- gsub("X", "", colnames(tmp))
Nxt.mat <- as.matrix(tmp)
```
Q1.3 What is happening to the number of births from 2014 to 2015?

A. They are increasing as a residual effect of past population growth.

B. They are declining at a rate of 1 or 2 percent a year


{{
qnumber = 1.3
correct.answer = "B"
hint = "Inspect the matrix of births"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Fertility has been low so long in Japan that births are
exponentially declining at a fairly steady rate"
}}


Let's now visualize the change in Japan's age structure. We start by
viewing the change frame-by-frame:

```{r}

year.vec <- colnames(Nxt.mat)
for (i in 1:length(year.vec))
{
    barplot(Nxt.mat[,i], horiz = T,
            xlim = c(0, 2.5 * 10^6))
    title(year.vec[i])
##     Sys.sleep(1/10)
}

```

Or we can compare a few snapshots every 20 years.

```{r}
my.year.vec <- c("1950", "1970", "1990", "2010")

for (i in 1:length(my.year.vec))
{
    print(i)
    this.year <- my.year.vec[i]
    barplot(Nxt.mat[,this.year], horiz = T,
            xlim = c(0, 2.5 * 10^6))
    title(my.year.vec[i])
}

```


If we look at the effects of fertility decline on the population
age-structure, we can see a very young population in the 1940s,
followed by a dramatic drop in the fraction of the young in the 1970s
and 1980s. Since the 1980s, the smaller birth cohorts have entered the
workforce, and the ratio of the elderly to workers has risen sharply.

From the point of view of population age-structure, is Japan worse off
today than it was right after WWII? From a well-being point of view,
we care about the social and economic roles of people of different
ages. Demographers use dependency ratios as summary statistics of the
population age-distribution.. We will use the following conventions,
where we define the youth as being aged 0-19, the workers aged 20-64,
and old-age'd as aged 65+.

* Youth Dependency Ratio: $ YDR = N(0-19) / N(20-64)$
* Old-age Dependency Ratio: $ OADR = N(65+) / N(20-64)$
* Total Dependency Ratio: $ TDR = YDR + OADR$

We will use R to loop through each year and create vectors for the
numbers of youth, workers, and elderly by year.

```{r}

x <- 0:110                              # ages

young.vec <- apply(Nxt.mat[x %in% 0:19,], 2, sum)
worker.vec <- apply(Nxt.mat[x %in% 20:64,], 2, sum)
old.vec <- apply(Nxt.mat[x %in% 65:110,], 2, sum)

ydr.vec <- young.vec/worker.vec
oadr.vec <- old.vec/worker.vec
tdr.vec <- oadr.vec + ydr.vec
plot(year.vec, tdr.vec)

```

Q1.4 Wait, is something wrong?

A. Yes, the total dependency ratio can not be greater than 1.0 -- we made
a mistake.

B. Yes, the dependency ratio even with the contemporary, very aged
population, is lower than it was before fertility decline. We made a
mistake.

C. No. This is right



{{
qnumber = 1.4
correct.answer = "C"
hint = "A ratio of can be greater than 1 -- it usually isn't but here
it is."
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Nothing is wrong. As we'll see below"
}}

Let's now look at the three dependency ratios on the same graph:

```{r}

plot(year.vec, oadr.vec, ylim = c(0, 1.5),
     type = "l", col = "red", lwd = 3,
     ylab = "Dependents per worker")
lines(year.vec, tdr.vec, col = "black", lwd = 3)
lines(year.vec, ydr.vec, col = "blue", lwd = 3)
text(1960, .4, "Youth \n Dep Ratio",
     col = "blue")
text(1970, 1, "Total \n Dep Ratio",
     col = "black")
text(1960, .2, "Old \n Dep Ratio",
     col = "red")

```

Now we can see that the youth dependency ratio has fallen more than
the old-age dependency ratio has risen. Total dependency has not yet
reached it's post-war highs.

Q1.5 Why does the youth dependency ratio fall sooner than the old-age
dependency ratio?

A. Because when births fall, there is a lag of a few decades between
fewer babies and fewer workers.

B. Because total dependency fell and then rose.

C. Because mortality fell before fertility




{{
qnumber = 1.5
correct.answer = "A"
hint = "A correct statement, but doesn't answer the question."
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "This lull in dependency is called
the 'Demographic Dividend'".
}}



# Part 1. Japan's Future?

We now project Japan's population to see how the history of low
fertility will play out over time. We assume here that fertility will
remain at it's current levels. This will tend to produce quite a bit
of population aging, more so that would occur if, as some expect,
fertility were to rebound somewhat. On the other hand, we also assume
no continued increase in longevity -- which is surely unrealistic --
and this our picture will have fewer survivors to old age than is
likely. On balance, this very simple projection probably gives us a
not-unrealistic view of Japan's future. (Note: we also leave out any
immigration.)


We begin by inspecting the projection matrix from 2014 rates that we
imported earlier.

Let's look at the first row
```{r}
print(A.2014[1,])
```

And let's print the elements showing survivors
```{r}
print(A.2014[-1,][A.2014 > 0]) # this gives us the elements that are > 0 that aren't in the first row
```

To see the whole matrix is a bit difficult since it is so large. You
can scroll. But you can also do a 3-d picture

```{r}
## 3 D picture

# Part 3. Adding detail with refined age-schedules

Do kids cost the same as the elderly? Does a 20 year old produce the
as much as a 50 year old? Does a 90 year old need more care than a 70
year old?

Counting the ratio of dependents to workers, assuming that all ages
within these groups are equivalent seems unrealistic.


Survey data enables age-specific estimates of consumption and
production ("income") by age. The methodology for creating these
estimates is somewhat complex, but the findings are quite robuts. Here
we use the same schedules that were used by Ron Lee et al. in the
reading to get more refined measures.

Let's look at the estimates of income and consumption by age in Japan.

```
## plot them
```

Q At what age do Japanese first produce as much as they consume?

Q. At what older age do they first consume more than they produce?


Assume these schedules were fixed and apply them to your population
projections.

# Part 3. Optimimum fertility (using stable populations)

In this final section of the lab, we will try to reproduce some of the
results on optimal fertility in the Lee et al. reading.

The criterion that Lee et al try to optimise is the "support ratio",
defined as

$$
SR = { \sum_x N(x) y(x) \over \sum_x N(x) c(x)},
$$

where $N(x)$ is the number of people aged $x$, $y(x)$ is the
production per person aged $x$, and $c(x)$ is the consumption per
person aged $x$.

In a stable population, we derived in class the result that
$$
n(x) = b e^{-rx} \ell(x),
$$
where $n(x)$ is the proportion of people aged $x$.

The numbers in each age group will be
$$
N(x) = B e^{-rx} \ell(x).
$$

So putting this together, and cancelling out the $B$, which are the
same in the numerator and the denomintor of the support ratio, we get

$$
SR = { \sum_x e^{-rx} \ell(x) y(x) \over \sum_x e^{-rx} \ell(x) c(x)},
$$

We can now use this formula to study how the support ratio will vary
with the growth rate of the population and with fertility.

```{r}

## code for effect of r on SR
```

We can now see if we have an optimal fertility rate

```{r}
plot(r.vec, SR.vec)
abline(v = 2.1)                         # adjust this to point to the optimum
```
We can also tell the computer to tell us the maximum, although the syntax
```{r}
print(r.vec[which.max(SR.vec)])
## which is short-hand for the harder to read:
print(r.vec[which(SR.vec == max(SR.vec))])
```

There are two things to note here:

1. The optimum is not equal to zero growth, it is found when there is
   slightly positive growth. The reason for this is that the
   life-cycle consumption schedule is tilted toward the elderly, and
   so there is some pay-off to having a few more young and a few less
   elderly.

2. Because changes in growth rate increase one dependent group and
   decrease another, the net effect is not large. Thus, although we
   find an optimum, the difference it makes in consumption to be at
   the optimum or to not be is not enormous.

Q By what fraction does consumption decline if we had 1 child "too
few"?

# Part 4. Another Capital Idea

To finish up, let's combine the fertility on  population age
structure, with the effects of fertility on the population growth rate
and capital accumulation. This allows us to use the Solow model once
again to gain some insights into both the qualititative and the
quantitative effects of population growth rates.


There are many ways to do this, several of which are discussed in
detail in the supplementary materials of the Lee et al reading. Here,
we use what they call the "low cost capital approach," which assumes
that the capital-output ratio stays constant over time. (This is the
simplified approach that Piketty builds upon.)

In the Solow model, faster population growth rates will require larger
fractions of income saved in order to preserve the stock of capital.

In the steady state, we have savings per person equaling the new
capital needed to keep up with pouplation growth $n$, depreciation
$d$, and technological advances $\lambda$,
$$
s y = (n + d + \lambda) k
$$

We can rearrange this steady-state to give us.

$$
s = (n + d + \lambda) (k / y)
$$

Lee et al assume that $k/y \approx 3$, $d = 0.05$, and $\lambda =
.02$. This allows calculation of $s$ as a funciton only of $n$.

```{r}
d = .05
lambda = .02
k.over.y = 3.0
s.vec = (r.vec + d + \lambda) * k.over.y
plot(r.vec, s.vec)
```

To take account of the effect of increased savings on the support
ratio, we reduce the effective production of workers by a factor of
$(1-s)$, so that the more savings is required the less produciton is
available for consumption.

$$
SR_{capital} = { \sum_x (1- s(r)) e^{-rx} \ell(x) y(x) \over \sum_x e^{-rx} \ell(x) c(x)},
$$
where we use the savings rate $s(r)$ that corresponds to the
population growth rate.

```{r}
                                        # insert code here

```

# Graded Questions


1. Stable populations are like teeter-totters, when there are more
   elderly there are fewer children, and vice versa. Write an
   expression for the ratio of 70-year olds to 10-year olds as a function
   of the population growth rate $r$, and the survival by age
   $\ell(x)$.

2. In real populations undergoing the demographic transition,
   fertility decline is not immediately offset by a large increase in
   the share of the elderly. Describe what happens to the total dependency
   ratio the course of the demographic transition and whether the
   actual effect of fertility decline over time could be more postive
   than we found by comparing the long-term steady state age
   structures fo stable populatons.

3. Does including capital in the economy make pro-baby politics more
   attractive or less attractive? Explain based on the results of the
   final part of the lab.

Julian Simon liked to proclaim that

> The only true measure of scarcity is price ...

In this lab we are going to take advantage of a database put together
by David Jacks. The data for his paper "From Boom to Bust: A Typology
of Real Commodity Prices in the Long Run" (2013, NBER Working Paper
18874) has consistent series of commodity prices for everything
ranging from barley to zinc. For our lab we've selected prices
since 1900.

We're going to ask the following:

1. What has been the long-term trend in commodity prices?

2. Was Simon lucky to have won the bet?

3. Do commodity price trends differ by commodity in a way that we can
   understand? (This section will be more exploratory than in past
   labs. Here the important point is to report what you find, not to
   find a specific  "right" answer.)

4. Finally, we will use our Malthusian "harvest" model to learn about
   renewable resources. (We may or may not get to this in class this
   week. If not, then this part of the lab will be pushed into next
   week, when we have no lab).



# Part 1. Read in data and graph trends in commodity prices

These commodity prices are modified in two ways. First, the nominal
prices have been adjusted for inflation. Second, all prices are
indexed to 100 in 1900. This makes it easy for us to compare across
commodities and over time.

```{r}
s## get commodity data from class website
path <- "http://courses.demog.berkeley.edu/goldstein175/Basket/"
## path <- "../Basket/"
file <- "Real_commodity_prices_1900_2015.csv"
url <- paste0(path, file)               # full url
commod <- read.table(url, sep = ",") # read the data into, with column header
head(commod) # looks at first few lines
```
You can scroll to the right and left using the black arrows in the display of the data.

Q1.1 What does the number 110.51 under Zinc mean?

A.  Zinc costs 110.51 cents per pound

B.  Zinc prices increased by about 110 percent between 1900 and 1904

C.  Zinc cost about 10.51 percent more in *nominal* terms in 1904 than in 1900

D.  Zinc cost 10.51 percent more in *real* terms in 1904 than in 1900

{{
qnumber = 1.1
correct.answer = "D"
hint = "Prices are indexed to 1900 and are adjusted for inflation"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "Real prices adjust for inflation"
}}


Q1.2 What is the major use of Chromium?

A.  For browsing the internet

B.  As Chrome plating and stainless steel

C.  As vitamin supplement for breakfast cereal

D.  As a precious metal for storing value

{{

instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "According to wikipedia, 85 percent is apparently used
for this one purpose. Are there substitutes for protecting steel?"
}}

 To select a value from this matrix of data you can index by the label
of the row and column. For example,
```{r}
commod["1963", "Chromium"]
## note for those interested in R:
## the index "1963" needs to be in quotes, otherwise R will think it
## is the 1963rd row of the matrix. Here we're telling it that it is
## the row labeled "1963".
```
tells us that the real price of Chromium in 1963 was 55 percent of that
in 1900.

> (Note: in the rest of the lab, when we say "price" we mean  "real
> price", unless otherwise stated.)

# Part 2. Visualizing commodity prices

Let's see how the price of Chromium varies over time.

```{r}
year.vec <- rownames(commod)
plot(year.vec, commod$Chromium, type = "l")
abline(v = 1980)                        # the date of "the bet"
```
Q2.1 How would you describe the history of Chromium prices?

A. Steadily rising

B. Steadily falling

C. Very volatile, with little clear long-term trend

D. Very volatile, with a clear upward trend

{{
qnumber = 2.1
correct.answer = "C"
hint = "Sorry, no hint"
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "There's clearly a lot of volitility. Although the price in 2015 is higher than in 1900, this doesn't look like a clear trend, since for much of the 20th century the price was lower than in 1900."
}}

## What does "trendless" data look like?

Imagine a "random walk", in which prices go up or down each year by
some random amount that averages zero. Each realization of this random
walk will have, by luck, some trend, but the underlying process
generating the randomness has no trend -- on average the change is
"zero". It is very easy to falsely interpret a random walk as having
an underlying trend. The subject of how to make inferences about the
trend of a time series is covered in an econometrics or statistics
class. For now, we will just look at some realizations of the random
walk to get a feeling for what random realizations of trendless data
can look like.

```{r}
## here's the function
plot.random.walk <- function(seed)
{
    set.seed(seed)                      # this initializes the random
                                        # number generator used in
                                        # sample(). If we use the same
                                        # seed, we will get the same
                                        # set of "random" numbers.
    random.steps <- sample(x = c(-1,1), size = 40, replace = TRUE)
    ## this selects the number -1 or 1 randomly 40 times
    random.walk <- cumsum(random.steps)
    ## this turns the random steps into a walk by summing them up.
    ## cumsum(c(1,2,3)) returns a vector with values 1, 3, and 6.
    plot(1:40, random.walk, type = "l")
}
```

Here's an example
```{r}
plot.random.walk(seed = 23)             # Here we set seed to 23
```


Modify the code below to try 1,2, 3, and 4 as "seeds"
```{r}
plot.random.walk(seed = 23)
plot.random.walk(seed = 23)
plot.random.walk(seed = 23)
plot.random.walk(seed = 23)
```

Q.2.2 Which of the following seems to be true

A. Even if price changes are random, averaging zero, the realization
of a random process can look like it has a trend.

B. A historical trend is the one reality we observe and we shouldn't let
anyone confuse us with alternative random realizations.

C. Thinking about randomness may help us understand and interpret the
reality we see and thus is a subject worth of study.

## Repeating for Tin

Plot the price of tin. You can use the same code we used for Chromium, modifying just slightly.
```{r}

Q2.3 Why do you think Ehrlich chose Tin as one of his commodities to bet on?

A.  Tin is difficult to substitute for

B.  Tin had shown a sharp increase in price for the decade or so before 1980 and so it looked like it would continue.

C.  The price had been going down before 1980 and was ready for a recovery

D.  There was evidence that the tin mines were running out of ore

}}


# Part 3. Replicating actual bet

In the original bet, Ehrlich was allowed to choose any commodities he
wished. He chose Chromium, Copper, Tin, Tungsten, and Nickel. In our
data, we don't have Tungsten. We can check to see if Simon still wins
with the four commodities we have.

> See the Lam reading, p. 1242 for an account of the bet.

We will use a function to compare commodities over time. This uses the
indexing by label we did above. It returns the change in value of a
$1000 purchase of the commodity basket in the start year. So if the
functions returns +100, this means mean that the value of the commodity
basket increased by $100.

Q3.1 If the value of the basket increased by $100, who would win?

A. Simon

B. Ehrlich

C. Neither, because the value of the basket doesn't tell us if
*all* of the commodities increased in price at the same time.

    holdings.vec <- dollars.per.commod/start.price
    ## value at the end
    value.at.end <- sum(holdings.vec * end.price)
    change.in.value <- value.at.end - start.funds
    return(change.in.value)
}

who.wins.fun <- function(change.in.value)
{
    ifelse(change.in.value > 0, "ehrlich", "simon")
}

```

Let's try this for 1980 to 1990 with Ehrlich's basket.

```{r}
ehrlich.basket.vec <- c("Copper", "Chromium", "Nickel", "Tin")
original.bet.result <- bet.fun("start" = 1980,
                      "end" = 1990,
                      "basket.vec" = ehrlich.basket.vec,
                      "data" = commod)
who.wins.fun(original.bet.result)
```

Q3.2 How much would Simon have won with our version of the "bet"?

A. About 300 dollars

B. He wouldn't have won. He would have lost about 300 dollars

C. About 500 dollars

D. About 100 dollars

{{
qnumber = 3.2
correct.answer = "A"
hint = "Insert a line: 'print(original.bet.result)' in the code chunk to see the result of the bet."
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "A negative number means prices went down, and so Simon would have won."
}}




# Part 4. Does Simon win in other periods?

Commodities are highly volitile. Even if commodities were generally
rising, Ehrlich could have been unlucky about the timing of his bet.

Let's check over all years since 1900. We can construct a "loop" using
R that will repeat the bet according to our instructions. We can then
save the output in a vector and make a judgement about whether Ehrlich
was simply unlucky.

Here's a simple example of a loop, in which we repeat an action 7 times,
incrementing the value of "i", and printing this value along with a label
"iteration".
```{r}
for (i in 1:7)   ## the variable "i" takes the value 1, 2, 3, ...
{
    ## anything in between {} is done once
    ## for each value that "i" takes
    print(c("iteration", i))
}
```

Now let's do a loop to see who won the bet in every year of the last
century.

```{r}
start.vec <- 1900:2005        ## a vector of years to start the bet
bet.result.vec <- rep(NA, length(start.vec)) ## an empty vector to be
                                             ## used to store the
                                             ## results
names(bet.result.vec) <- start.vec ## labeling the elements (you can ignore)
for (i in 1:length(start.vec))
{
    bet.result.vec[i] <- bet.fun(start = start.vec[i],
                                 end = start.vec[i] + 10,
                                 basket.vec = ehrlich.basket.vec,
                                 data = commod)
}
print(bet.result.vec)
```

To summarize our results, let's look at them in several ways.

Plot the numbers
```{r}
plot(start.vec, bet.result.vec)
abline(h = 0)
text(1960, 1500, "Ehrlich wins", col = "blue")
text(1960, -250, "Simon wins", col = "red")
```
In the graph, it looks like Ehrlich would have won more of the time. But not a lot more.

Let's tabulate how many times Ehrlich and Simon would have won:
```{r}
## Convert to a vector of "simon" and "ehrlich", depending on who won
winners.vec <- who.wins.fun(bet.result.vec)
print(winners.vec)
```
```{r}
## count number of times each won using the "table()" function
table(winners.vec)
```

Q4.1 What percent of the time would Ehrlich have won of the 106 simulated bets from 1900 to 2005?

A. About 62 percent

B. About 58 percent

{{
qnumber = 4.1
correct.answer = "B"
hint = "Insert there are 106 bets, not 100."
instructions = "Replace the NA with your answer (e.g., 'A' in quotes)"
explanation = "62/106 is about 0.58."
}}


Make a fancier plot. (You don't need to understand this code.)
```{r}
plot(start.vec, bet.result.vec, type = "n") #an empty plot
abline(h = 0)
e <- which(winners.vec == "ehrlich")    # T or F, to subset text()
s <- which(winners.vec == "simon")
text(x = start.vec[e], y = bet.result.vec[e], labels = "e", col = "blue")
text(x = start.vec[s], y = bet.result.vec[s], labels = "s", col = "red")
text(1960, 1500, "Ehrlich wins", col = "blue")
text(1960, -250, "Simon wins", col = "red")
```


# 5. Generalizing the bet to other commodities

A change in the supply of a particular commodity may or may not cause
a large price change -- depending on the availability of
substitutes. (Note: the results from this section will be useful for
your write-up of the graded questions at the end of the lab.)

Q5.1 Pick a commodity that you think has a lot of substitutes and see
     what fraction of the all of the 10 year bets from 1900 to 2005
     Ehrlich would have won.

Q5.2 Repeat Q5.1 for a commodity that you think is difficult to
     substitute for.

The following code provides a template for a single commodity, in this
case "Chromium".

```{r}
start.vec <- 1900:2005
result.vec <- rep(NA, length(start.vec))
for (i in 1:length(start.vec))
  {
  result.vec[i] <- bet.fun(start = start.vec[i],
                      end = start.vec[i] + 10,
                      basket.vec = c("Chromium"),
                      data = commod)
}
winner.vec <- who.wins.fun(result.vec)
cat("counts:\n")
table(winner.vec)
cat("proportions:\n")
prop.table(table(winner.vec))
```

Well done. You are finished with the computing portion of Lab 4.

>   [Explain your answer in a 2 or 3 sentences.]

> 3. Discuss the results of your analysis of an easily substitutable
>   commodity. (As noted at the beginning of the lab, this section is

>   i. Tell why you think that this commodity would be easily
>   substitutable, explaining what "service" it provides. [1 or 2
>   sentences]

>  ii. What did your analysis tell you about whether prices
>  consistently increased? [1 or 2 sentences]

>  iii. Interpret your results [1 or  2 sentences]

> 4. Repeat question 3 (i,ii, and iii), but for the commodity you thought
>   would be hard to substitute for.

> 5. Did your results in 3 and 4 differ substantially from each other or
>    from the results of Ehrlich and Simon's bet? [< 50 words]

> 6. What are two reasons prices might not reflect the long-term
>    availability of a commodity. [A sentence on each.]

> 7. Renewable resources (check on bCourses to see if this
>	problem will be due as part of this lab or is being postponed.)

> i. Imagine a community living by a large lake full of fish. Each
>    household in the community catches ten fish per day, which is the
>    maximum sustainable yield. A technological innovation allows the
